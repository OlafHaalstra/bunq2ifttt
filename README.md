# bunq2IFTTT

This app creates an interface between the [bunq](https://www.bunq.com/) 
banking API and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

Features are:
- Real time triggers on mutations, balances and incoming requests
- The ability to make (draft) payments
- Security oriented, using OAuth where possible and by separating higher 
  access in master/slave mode

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/woudt/bunq2ifttt/wiki) page for installation
and usage instructions.

This is [open source](https://github.com/woudt/bunq2ifttt/blob/master/LICENSE) 
software, which you can use free of charge (but please note the disclaimer 
below). Feel free to [buy me a beer](https://bunq.me/bunq2IFTTT) though ;)
